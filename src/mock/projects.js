        text: "**The Problem** Gaza’s water crisis is exacerbated by chronic electricity shortages, which restrict water wells to operating for only one hour per day. This limitation results in severe shortages, leaving many families unable to access adequate amounts of clean water. For example, a well located in Khan Younis, Block G, Al-Dahra area, can only pump water for an hour daily due to energy constraints. The current reliance on diesel fuel adds to the problem, with costs as high as 120 shekels per litre, making it prohibitively expensive. Filling just one cup of water costs 40 shekels, and while the well owner generously donates two cups of water daily to the community, this is far from sufficient to meet the needs of local families. On average, each household requires about two jerrycans (approximately 40 litres) of water daily, which is not sustainable under the current system.",

The solar panels are sourced from local vendors and providers, ensuring that the system is adapted to the specific needs and conditions of the region.",
